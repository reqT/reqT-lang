# reqt-lang

* The **reqt language** is the core of the **reqT tool** for software requirements modelling.

* The reqt language helps to structure natural-language requirements into semi-formal models using common requirements engineering concepts. 

* This repo includes a parser and other utilities for the reqt language. The parser produces an immutable tree data structure called `Model` that is expressed using a Scala-embedded DSL, also part of this repo. 

* With the reqt Scala-embedded DSL you can analyze and transform your requirements models using the power of the Scala standard library and the Scala ecosystem.
